    Regex pattern to match, if matched, you can use the replacement option to replace it
    like <code>(.*)</code>
    this plugin would initialize a regex matcher to match the claim value, and then execute
    replaceAll with the following <code>replacement</code> field
    If not set, replace would not be done, claim will be untouched.
